1. What problem am I exploring?
Answer. The problem I am exploring is understanding how machine learning models learn patterns from financial data and how those learned patterns can support decision-making such as risk assessment or loan-related decisions. My focus is not on predicting exact outcomes, but on understanding how inputs, patterns, and assumptions influence model behavior in a finance context.

2. Why finance as context?
Answer: I chose finance as a context because it involves structured data, clear outcomes, and real-world constraints. Coming from a commerce background, I find it easier to reason about financial variables such as income, risk, and returns, which makes it a suitable domain for deeply understanding how machine learning models behave.

3. What am I NOT trying to do?
Answer: I am not trying to build models that produce outputs without understanding the reasoning behind them. My goal is not just to predict values like loan amounts, but to understand the patterns, trends, and assumptions that lead the model to those predictions.
